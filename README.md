# Model Evaluation Demo

This repository demonstrates the importance of tracking model metrics across iterations. It showcases how different changes to model architecture, data, and training procedures affect various performance metrics.

## Key Features
- Multiple datasets demonstrating different evaluation scenarios
- Clear metric tracking across commits
- Examples of both improvements and regressions in different metrics
- Demonstration of metric changes in data slices

## Model Iterations
1. Baseline Model (commit: xxxxx)
   - Basic implementation
   - Metrics: Accuracy: 0.75, F1: 0.73

2. Regularized Model (commit: xxxxx)
   - Added L2 regularization
   - Metrics: Accuracy: 0.73, F1: 0.76
   - Note: Slight accuracy drop but better generalization

[... continue with other iterations ...]

## Why Track Metrics?
This demo shows how changes that seem positive might have hidden tradeoffs:
- Improved accuracy but decreased fairness
- Better average performance but worse performance on important subgroups
- Faster inference but lower precision
